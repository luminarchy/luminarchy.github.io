                    <h3>AMD 2025 AI Voice Agent
                    </h3>
                    <p>An AI Agent application using MCP (model context protocol) and Open WebUI using gpu acceleration on AMD’s MI300x. Uses a server to connect a xLAM model to any labeled dataset for informed, specific task execution, and sends receives requests using voice and audio. These requests are processed using the xLAM model and can request sampling from the llm if necessary. This project was demoed at the 2025 AMD Partner Summit using a database of PoetryFoundation poems as an example.</p>

                    <p>An AI Vision agent that uses a Phi multimodal model and a document layout segmentation model to segment text, headers, and images from a document for text classification. Has additional colorspace conversion features to simulate and correct for color-blindness to promote accessibility in documentation.  </p>

                    <p>Studied under a faculty mentor to use reinforcement learning algorithms on training medical donning and doffing procedures. Worked on a 3D virtual reality simulation that could model the processes of an ill-trained reinforcement agent.</p>

                    <p>Worked with a faculty professor to use datasets to analyze color values that may seem undetectable to the human eye in images of skin lesions. Used a dynamic proximity hierarchy to map the color values and minimum spanning tree algorithms to create an self-learning model to detect potential melanoma. </p>

                    Writing
                </h1>
                <p>
                    On the side, I like to work on fun whimsical writing projects! I mainly do poetry, studying creative usages of rhyme, meter, and sound, as I am an oral writer, occaisionally dabbling in creative non-fiction.  
                </p>
                <p>This portfolio is a showcase of my art in full, and as so, I would like to include my writing alongside my computer science work, as to me, these two areas in my life are not separate nor individual. They influence and interact with one another, and my work in the humanities allows me to become a better poet and computer scientist. </p>
                <p>My current favorite authors are Ocean Vuong, Sylvia Plath, W.B. Yeats, and Tennyson. </p>
